# Ubuntu - Stuck in Workspace Switcher

Somehow while dragging a window from one workspace to another, the system became stuck
The system wasn't frozen as the mouse still moved, but it was stuck and clicking didn't 
exit the switcher and the keyboard was unresponsive.

`Alt` + `Enter` exists the switcher and you can simply try again
